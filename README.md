**GDscript** provides syntax highlighting and autocompletion for the GDscript language in Godot4.

## Description

Take advantage of the Nova IDE to develop your game in Godot 4 with this extension allowing syntax coloring of GDscript.
You will also find in the Nova extension library, a theme allowing you to make the most of this syntax coloring and, basically, inspired by the coloring of the Playdate theme.
You will also find an extension to support LSP and code completion by connecting the Nova IDE to the Godot 4 engine.

Enjoy !

## Notes

I hope it will pleased you and have all the features and capabilities you need for.
I'm not an expert in tree-sitter, parsing and syntax definition.
If you have any improvements to suggest, do not hesitate to contact me so that I can implement them.
For my part, I should use this extension daily and update according to my needs if I encounter bugs or points of improvement during my use.
